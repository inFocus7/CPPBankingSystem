# CPPBankingSystem
First C++11 Project of mine where I'll tr to make a simple console banking system.

+Plan on integrating an SQL database to the code once I'm farther in order to store client information.
+After finishing, I plan on porting it to a Windows application with a UI.


Programs Used:
Visual Studio Community 2017

Just realized that classes wont really work so time to either save data on a text file, or work on integrating a database to store information sooner. Yay me!
